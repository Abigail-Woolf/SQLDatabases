# SQL Databases
Data modeling, engineering, and analysis in Postgres and PgAdmin

## Project Summary
I created a local Postgres database to hold the data for a company with several thousand employees. The data included information about employees, their age, and what department they currently work in. The goal of this project was to identify the cohort of employees who would be retiring in the near future. Because there are many baby boomers at this company, they will have to prepare for a massive shortage of employees when they leave the company. 

### ERD
The first step of this project was to create a physical entity relational diagram as a guide when I created tables in Postgres. There are six tables of data to be imported and this is the resulting ERD. Now that this has been made and the tables have been created, I will import the data into the database.
