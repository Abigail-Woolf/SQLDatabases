# SQL Databases
Data modeling, engineering, and analysis in Postgres and PgAdmin

## Project Summary
I created a local Postgres database to hold the data for a company with several thousand employees. The data included information about employees, their age, and what department they currently work in. The goal of this project was to identify the cohort of employees who would be retiring in the near future. Because there are many baby boomers at this company, they will have to prepare for a massive shortage of employees when they leave the company. 

### ERD
The first step of this project was to create a physical entity relational diagram as a guide when I created tables in Postgres. There are six tables of data to be imported and this is the resulting ERD. Now that this has been made and the tables have been created, I will import the data into the database.

#### Conslusion
Several thousand employees, baby boomers retire at rapid rate, offer retirement package for those meeting certain criteris, and who will fill job openings
Who is retiring
How many positions need to be filled
Elegibility for retirement package

 determine the total number of employees per title who will be retiring, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 
need technical report that details the analysis
Technical Analysis Deliverable 1: Number of Retiring Employees by Title. You will create three new tables, one showing number of [titles] retiring, one showing number of employees with each title, and one showing a list of current employees born between Jan. 1, 1952 and Dec. 31, 1955. New tables are exported as CSVs. 
Technical Analysis Deliverable 2: Mentorship Eligibility. A table containing employees who are eligible for the mentorship program You will submit your table and the CSV containing the data (and the CSV containing the data)
